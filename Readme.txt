R Shiny Mclust demonstration application

As part of my final year research project, myself and another student developed an R Shiny application to implement the functionality of the popular R package _mclust_. This is a package for model-based clustering, classification, and density estimation based on finite normal mixture modelling. For further detail please read our extensive report linked below. 

The application is split into two main parts: Clustering & Classification. Both of these sections 1. Demonstrate some of the main funtionality of the _mclust_ package via a demo section and 2. Allow users to use the package on their own data for basic analysis via the simple user interface.
